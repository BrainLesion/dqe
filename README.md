Quality prediction for brain tumor segmentation on a scale ranging from 1 &#x2B50; star to 6  &#x2B50;&#x2B50;&#x2B50;&#x2B50;&#x2B50;&#x2B50; stars inspired by the paper [**Deep Quality Estimation: Creating Surrogate Models for Human Quality Ratings**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10355).  
This can be used to estimate the quality of a BraTS glioma segmentation for evaluation purposes or as, e.g., as part of a loss function during model training.

> [!NOTE]  
> This package expects images in atlas space and segmentation labels in brats style, i.e.
> - `label 1` is the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core
> - `label 2` is the peritumoral edema
> - `label 3` is the GD-enhancing tumor (used to be `label 4` in older data; both are supported)


> [!NOTE]
The model here is not the original model presented in the paper. Instead, it is trained based on individual radiologists' ratings. This way, the model has a chance to learn the variance between radiologists' estimates. It outperforms the model presented in the paper on the test set.


## Installation

With a Python 3.9+ environment, you can install `deep_quality_estimation` directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deep_quality_estimation/):

```bash
pip install deep_quality_estimation
```


## Use Cases and Tutorials

A minimal example to predict the quality of a segmentation could look like this:

```python
from deep_quality_estimation import DQE

# shown parameters are default values but can be adapted to usecase
dqe = DQE(device="cuda", cuda_devices="0") 

# inputs can be Paths (str or pathlib.Path object), NumPy NDArrays or a mix
mean_score, scores_per_view = dqe.predict(
    t1c="t1c.nii.gz",
    t1="t1.nii.gz",
    t2="t2.nii.gz",
    flair="flair.nii.gz",
    segmentation="segmentation.nii.gz",
)
```
